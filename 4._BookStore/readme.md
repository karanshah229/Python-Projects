# BookStore GUI Application using Tkinter

---

## Features

1. A tkinter-python GUI app that maintains the record of all the books
2. The user can add, update, delete, view all the books in the database
3. Since this is a GUI application, I have also attached the .exe file that was  
created using PyInstaller

---

### Technology / Libraries Learnt and Used:
1. SqlLite3 - Database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) Operations on the books table
2. PyInstaller - To create an executable (.exe) file from the GUI created on Tkinter
3. Tkinter - To create the GUI for the application

---

## Install Instructions

1. Git clone the repository or alternatively download all the files in this folder
2. Navigate to the 'dist' folder
3. Double click the BookStore.exe file
3. The application will start and the user can now perform all CRUD operations
4. The application uses sqllite3 and the database is stored in the books.db file in the dist folder
5. If you are not able to see the books make sure you have the books.db file in the same folder as  
the BookStore.exe file
